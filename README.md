# genre_recognition
Based on a paper from Sander Dieleman : https://benanne.github.io/2014/08/05/spotify-cnns.html                                
The conv net is implemented with python keras library and reaches to accuracy of %60 on train and %50 on test data.
All the details such as input_size are commented out.                                                          
This project is separated into 3 main sections :                                                                                           
1.created mel_spectograms from raw inputs                                                                                              
2.pickle song mel_spectograms in related onehot vector in one final file (dataset.picle) and                                           
3.feed the created file to conv net, do some preprocessing, train the model and finaly evaluate the accuracy.
